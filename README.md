# Beetroot Detection using YOLOv8

## Project Overview

This project implements an object detection system to detect beetroots in images using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) architecture from Ultralytics. The goal is to accurately locate and classify beetroot instances within images to support agricultural automation or quality inspection tasks.

YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detector known for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications requiring quick processing.

## Motivation

Detecting agricultural produce like beetroot automatically can help improve harvesting efficiency, monitor crop health, and reduce manual labor. Leveraging deep learning and modern object detection architectures allows precise identification and localization of beetroots in various image conditions.

## Dataset Preparation

- **Image Data:** The dataset consists of approximately 90 images of beetroot plants.
- **Annotations:** Each image is labeled in the YOLO format (`.txt` files), which contains bounding box coordinates normalized relative to the image size.
- **Splitting:** The dataset is split into three subsets:
  - **Training set (70%)** for model learning.
  - **Validation set (20%)** to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
  - **Test set (10%)** to evaluate final model performance.

The folder structure follows YOLOv8's expected format:

```

images/
├── train/
├── val/
└── test/

labels/
├── train/
├── val/
└── test/

````

A `data.yaml` file defines the dataset path and class names for easy loading during training.

## Model and Training

- **Model:** Uses the pre-trained YOLOv8 medium (`yolov8m.pt`) weights as a starting point for transfer learning.
- **Training Framework:** Ultralytics YOLO Python API simplifies training, validation, and inference.
- **Training Process:**
  - Load the pretrained model.
  - Train on the prepared dataset with specified epochs.
  - Use data augmentation internally to improve generalization.
- **Benefits of Transfer Learning:** Starting from pretrained weights significantly accelerates convergence and improves accuracy compared to training from scratch.

## Evaluation and Metrics

After training, the model is validated on the test set with detailed metrics and visualizations:

- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows true positives, false positives, and false negatives per class, providing insight into detection accuracy and misclassifications.
- **Precision-Recall (PR) Curve:** Illustrates the tradeoff between precision and recall at different confidence thresholds.
- **F1 Score Curve:** Displays the harmonic mean of precision and recall across thresholds.
- **Visualized Predictions:** Annotated images showing detected bounding boxes and confidence scores.

These evaluation outputs are automatically saved in the `runs/val/exp/` directory and can be viewed as images or programmatically accessed for further analysis.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare the dataset:** Organize images and labels in the correct folder structure and create `data.yaml`.

2. **Train the model:** Use the Ultralytics YOLO API to train with:

    ```python
    from ultralytics import YOLO
    model = YOLO("yolov8m.pt")
    model.train(data="data.yaml", epochs=20)
    ```

3. **Validate the model:** Generate evaluation plots with:

    ```python
    results = model.val(data="data.yaml", split="test", save=True, plots=True)
    ```

4. **Visualize metrics:** Display confusion matrix and curves using the included Python script to load and show saved images.
